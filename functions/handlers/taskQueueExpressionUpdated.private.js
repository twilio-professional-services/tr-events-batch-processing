// when a task queue expression is updated
// this function will trigger all workers to be re-evaluated for their
// eligible queues.  This is necessary as we potentially need to remove the queue
// from some workers and add the queue to others.  Ideally we would keep a cache
// of the eligible worker sids for a queue so we could compare with the new list
// and update only thee deltas (ones removed and ones added to the list) however
// a robust caching mechanism with the tools available is quite hard to accomplish
// for an unbound object size.  Given how robust and quick the updates are, solution
// opted for is to just re-evaluate all the workers.
